About ideagen
-----
 CSC's next-gen Idea Generation innovation program aligns research with CSC's strategic and technology goals. The mission is to leverage research results for CSC strategy, offerings and competitive intelligence.

The program is designed as an agile alternative to traditional (and very expensive) formal research programs and is based on challenge-driven innovation (CDI).
The program is driven by research challenges: statements or questions that innovators work to solve. Rather than free-form research on a topic that interests you, research topics are pre-defined by the challenges. Challenges align with CSC strategy and reflect client and market needs. They are complex, difficult problems that, when solved, will have a big market impact.

In addition, to keep the idea flowing continuously, the program also engourages CSC employees to submit their innovative ideas as and when they get it so that they can be evaluated and perfected through a Proof of Concept.
